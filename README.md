### Three observable trends based on the data.
### 1. Generally there are significantly more male players, 84.03%, compared to female players and those players that where classified as other/non-disclosed
### 2. The majority of players are in the age group 20-24 years old. This could be a reflection of the time available for this age group to dedicate to games as they are likely to have less responsibilities compared to older age groups. On the other hand, they are likely to be working and hence can support their hobbies compared to the younger age groups.
### 3. Point 2 then highlights that this age group has the highest spending habits thus marketing to this age group would be done differently. Emphasis would then be put on marketing to the older generation to increase spending on these games.
